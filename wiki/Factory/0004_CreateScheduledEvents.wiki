= User Story =
In addition to simple reminders, I would like to be able to add items with
specific date/times associated with them.
= Solution Proposal =
This is going to be a rather involved task
* Allow users to add events with:
    * name
    * description
    * when (datetime)
    * duration
* Allow users to view events, listed in order of `when`
* Allow users to edit events, past, present, or future
* Clearly separate past events from future events
= Solution Breakdown =
* Create two tabs on main page
    * Reminders
        * will show the existing reminders page
    * Events
        * will show the new events page
* Create new events page
    * need `Event` model, table, context, api controller
    * events page should list events in order of `when`
    * events page should have an "add event" button
        * "add event" button opens form for creating new event
            * side pane?
    * each listed event has a "details" button for viewing and editing details
        * this should probably use the same "add event" form, with perhaps a few
            small variations, such as some fields being read-only (such as name)
            * not actually sure anything will be read-only at this point
== Design Decisions ==
* new `Event` model could, instead, be an expansion of the `Reminder` model
    * perhaps `Reminder` could be divided into `ToDo` and `Event` subclasses or
        simply have an `isScheduled` property
    * since you'll typically be working with these separately, I will keep them
        as separate models/tables
