= User Story =
SubTask of 0001
* Add `isCompleted` property to reminder model
* add `isCompleted` values to test data
* 
= Paths =
== Good ==
* User clicks "complete" (or performs some appropriate action)
    * item now shows clearly as being completed
    * e.g. box is checked or item is crossed-out
== Bad ==
* User clicks "complete" and Client fails to update item
    * Message should appear indicating a failure to update
== Ugly ==
* User is unable to click "complete"
* User clicks "complete" but another instance has since deleted the data
= Solution Proposal =
* add column to reminder table/type - `IsComplete`
* add button to reminder list items that calls `CompleteReminder`
* add service method that calls API to set IsComplete to true on reminder
* add API call to `CompleteReminder` that takes a reminder ID
* display completed reminders at the bottom of the page, crossed out
