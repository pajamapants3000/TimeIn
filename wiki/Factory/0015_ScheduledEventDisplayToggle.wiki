= User Story =
* Add a button toggle to ScheduledEventsComponent that tells the
ScheduledEventDisplayModule which display to use to display the events
* Expand ScheduledEventDisplayModule to support multiple display kinds
* Add a trivial second display kind - MonthlyCalendarComponent - for testing and
    demonstrating the ability of the button toggle
    * this component will be built upon in a later task
