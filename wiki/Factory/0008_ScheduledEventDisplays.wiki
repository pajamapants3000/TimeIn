= User Story =
We want our scheduled events to be viewable in multiple convenient ways:
* Monthly Calendar
* Weekly Schedule
* Day PLanner
= Solution Proposal =
* First, break each of these displays into separate tasks
* implement each display
* Add a feature, such as tabs, to allow easy switching between displays
    * actually, I think Material's Button toggle is a good choice:
        * https://material.angular.io/components/button-toggle/overview
= Solution Breakdown =
* create a ScheduledEventDisplay module
* add MonthlyCalendar component to the new module
    * all this component should do for now is display a message
* complete task 0012_CalendarDisplaySelect
* complete tasks 0009-0011
== Backend ==
* this is an all-frontend task; at least, I don't currently see any need for
    changes to the backend.
== Frontend ==
== Integration ==
== Coat of Paint ==
= Additional Tasks =

= Design Decisions =
* I think this is where I will start branching off to additional modules
    * should I have a separate module for each calendar display, or just one for
        all of them?
    * I think it makes sense to have a module dedicated to displaying scheduled
        events
        * so, my "design decision" is to create a ScheduledEventDisplay module
            * this module will have:
                * Components:
                    * DayPlanner
                    * WeeklySchedule
                    * MonthlyCalendar
                * I don't think there will be any need for models or services
