= User Story =
As a typical person with responsibilities, it would be nice if I could record
an upcoming obligation, task, or reminder. At any time I should be able to
review all of the reminders I have created.
= Solution Proposal =
* User adds an entry
    * the action/command accepts a single argument that is the entry value
* User requests a list of entries
    * TimeIn prints a list of all entries to the console
    * the entries are listed in order of when they were added, oldest first
= Solution Breakdown =
== Backend ==
=== API ===
* API method that stores a new reminder item
    * arguments:
        * string
            * entry (just a single string describing the reminder)
    * returns:
        * void
    * side effects:
        * entry is stored in a list
* API method that retrieves all reminders
    * arguments:
        * none
    * returns:
        * list of reminders, ordered oldest first
    * side effects:
        * none
=== Implementation ===

== Frontend ==
=== Modules ===

=== Components ===
* root
* add-reminder
    * single input textbox and "Add" button
* list-reminders
    * list (ul) of strings
