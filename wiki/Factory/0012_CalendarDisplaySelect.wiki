= User Story =
Make it possible for the user to switch between available displays for the list
of scheduled events.
= Solution Proposal =
* use Material's Button toggle as the user interface element
= Solution Breakdown =
* add button toggle
    * I think it should go on the same row as the "Add new event" button
    * left or right?
        * I think the button toggle should be to the right of the add button
* current options for button toggle should be "Full List" and "Calendar"
    * this is, of course, only a starting point, until we have the actual
        displays implemented
    * for now, "Full List" will show the current display, whereas "Calendar"
        will show a blank page (or perhaps just some simple text, like "I am
        a calendar"
