= User Story =
* take some time to review all code to clean it up and reorganize if needed
* review tests and consider whether they are complete, well chosen, and well-
    written
* remove code, variables and definitions, etc., that has no purpose
= Solution Proposal =
= Solution Breakdown =
== Backend ==
* I don't think there is much to do here since there isn't much to it yet, but
    take a look just in case
== Frontend ==
== Integration ==
* not really applicable, except perhaps in the end-to-end tests
== Coat of Paint ==
* one thing that might be good to do here is try to improve the UI a bit
