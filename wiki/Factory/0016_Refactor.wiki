= User Story =
* take some time to review all code to clean it up and reorganize if needed
* review tests and consider whether they are complete, well chosen, and well-
    written
* remove code, variables and definitions, etc., that has no purpose
= Solution Proposal =
= Solution Breakdown =
== Backend ==
* I don't think there is much to do here since there isn't much to it yet, but
    take a look just in case
== Frontend ==
=== ScheduledEventsComponent ===
* [ ] eliminate displayUpdateSwitch
    * [ ] instead, utilize the sidenav `opened` property
* [ ] Create ViewChild for:
    * [ ] mat-sidenav element
        * [ ] set `opened` property in place of `isDetailsOpen`
    * [ ] app-scheduled-event-display element
        * [ ] set `scheduledEvents$` property without intermediate of same name
        * [ ] set `currentDisplayKind` property without intermediate of same name
    * [ ] app-scheduled-event-details element
        * [ ] set `detailsId` property without intermediate of same name
* [ ] update tests to make clear, clean account of behavior
    * focus on interaction with other components, and with user
== Integration ==
* not really applicable, except perhaps in the end-to-end tests
== Coat of Paint ==
* one thing that might be good to do here is try to improve the UI a bit
