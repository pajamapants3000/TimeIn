= Solution Breakdown =
* Once a button toggle is added (Task-0008), add an option for "Month"
* When "Month" is selected, replace the current scheduled event list display
    with a basic outline of a monthly calendar
    * requirements:
        * seven columns
        * header row displaying days SUN - SAT
        * six additional rows, adjustable count but for now fixed to six
        * expands/contracts with display size
        * each cell has a border
* Once this basic layout is in place, add the heading and dates to show the
    current month
    * requirements:
        * rows now add to necessary count to show days in month
        * days are correctly numbered for current month
* next, add paging that will allow the user to change to different months
    * requirements:
        * Month Year shown
        * increment/decrement by month
        * correctly changes year as increment past December or decrement past

* this is an all-frontend task; at least, I don't currently see any need for
    changes to the backend.
