= User Story =
SubTask of 0001
* before making further changes to model and data, I want to have the test data
    used by both the API and ClientUi projects sourced from one location

* ClientUi test, end-to-end test, and API test (though none yet) pull test data
    from same place
== Bad ==
== Ugly ==
= Solution Proposal =
* create JSON file to store test data
* should support full database - multiple tables
* need to import this in SQL (reset_test_data.sql) as well as Angular/TypeScript
