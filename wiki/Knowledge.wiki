= The Problem with UWP =
* Universal Windows applications cannot use consoles as UI
    * there is a new, experimental project template to allow this, but it
        requires writing the console app in C++
    * UWP applications will not work with .NET Core or .NET Framework
        * this is true not only as UWP libraries with core and framework console
            applications, but UWP applications (.exe) with .NET Core and
            .NET Framework libraries!
    * bottom line: Universal Windows is simply not compatible with these other
        frameworks in any way
    * Therefore, I don't think it's possible to write a console UI to use as
        a testing UI for UWP applications
    * what about an MVC or Web API application referencing a UWP library?
        * these are .NET Core/Framework! So.... NO :(
* I don't think UWP is an appropriate framework for this application
    * it seems better suited for simpler applications, focused on an attractive
        user experience more than a great deal of functionality and complexity
    * I will have to come up with another idea to practice UWP development
* ~~Moving forward, this is a WPF application~~
    * ~~this means targeting .NET Framework (I'll use 4.7.1)~~
    * ~~web front end will also have to use .NET Framework~~
    * unless I just want to do .NET core with a console app and web front end?
    * I _have_ been wanting to experiment with MVC and Angular...
    * plus, I already have a WPF application I want to write - The Library.
    * sold!
