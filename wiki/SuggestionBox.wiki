= Initialize =
As a typical person with responsibilities, it would be nice if I could record
an upcoming obligation or task, perhaps with a date and time if applicable,
along with something to identify the obligation, so that later I could
review my upcoming obligations and avoid forgetting anything important.
= Data Persistence =
As a typical user, I just want to be able to close the application and still
see my schedule the next time I open it, without having to re-enter everything.
= Schedule Nonscheduled Events =
As someone who has a lot to do but doesn't always know when I'll have time, I
would like to be able to record my todo list items and later schedule them when
I decide when I will have time for them.
