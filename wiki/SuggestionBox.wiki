= Mark as complete =
Any reminder that has been created should have the ability to be marked as
complete.
- Created Task 0001
= Completion Details =
When completing a reminder, it should be possible to note whether the item
was completed, disregarded, or whatever likely might have been the outcome.
= Create scheduled events =
In addition to simple reminders, I would like to be able to add items with
specific date/times associated with them.
= Schedule Nonscheduled Events =
As someone who has a lot to do but doesn't always know when I'll have time, I
would like to be able to record my todo list items and later schedule them when
I decide when I will have time for them.
= User Profiles =
Currently the application works for a single user. Add a login screen and store
and access data on a per-user basis.

= Completed Tasks =
== Data Persistence ==
As a typical user, I just want to be able to close the application and still
see my schedule the next time I open it, without having to re-enter everything.
- Created Task 0000
- Completed
== Initialize ==
As a typical person with responsibilities, it would be nice if I could record
an upcoming obligation, task, or reminder. At any time I should be able to
review all of the reminders I have created.
- Created Task 0000
