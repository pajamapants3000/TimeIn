%title Concept | TimeIn | Projects

* TimeIn is all about managing your time, so that you:
    a) maximize the time you have
    b) keep up with your schedule - always on time
    c) find time to do the things you didn't think you had time for
    d) never forget an event or appointment
    e) have a record of how you have spent your time, whether it be as simple
        as your past calendar, or more elaborate with post-event commentary and
        a well-integrated diary
    f) can achieve long-term goals by planning stepping-stone accomplishments
        and tracking your progress
